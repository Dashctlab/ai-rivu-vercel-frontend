      <h1>About AI-RIVU</h1>
      <p>
        AI-RIVU is the first and flagship product of Asmakam Innovations, built to empower India’s teachers with AI-driven tools.  
        AI-RIVU will cultivate the next generation with stronger curriculum rigor—shaping student careers, strengthening our nation’s foundation, 
        and democratising quality education for all. It will enable educators to become vastly more efficient and help every teacher teach better.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that every educator deserves access to cutting-edge technology—without the technical overhead—and that seamless, 
        intelligent assistance can transform how lessons are planned, delivered, and assessed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Asmakam Innovations was founded on the conviction that technology can help our future be bright. “Asmakam” (meaning “ours” in Sanskrit) 
        drives the core value of growing together as a community with a goal of bettering lives, increasing efficiency, and improving access to technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In early 2025, our team—rooted in Bangalore but passionate about India’s heartland—launched AI-RIVU (a play on “Arivu,” meaning “knowledge” in Tamil). 
        AI can level the playing field for educators outside major metros. Starting with our Question Paper Generator, we are rapidly expanding our toolkit 
        to support lesson planning, grading, and more—making every school more efficient and education more accessible.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To give every teacher the power to create high-quality, curriculum-aligned materials in minutes—so they can focus on what truly matters: inspiring young minds.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        A future where no teacher feels constrained by time, resources, or technical know-how; where AI quietly handles the heavy lifting, 
        and educators reclaim their creativity and connection in the classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        A future where every school student, regardless of background, gets access to the best education and embarks on the career of their choice.
      </p>
